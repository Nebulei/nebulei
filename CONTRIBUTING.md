# Contributing to Nebulei

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Nebulei**! We welcome contributions that help improve the library, expand its features, and ensure it remains robust and future-proof. This guide outlines how to contribute, the process for reporting issues or submitting changes, and our coding and documentation standards.

## Our Vision

Nebulei is designed to be a modular, open-source library that provides real-time intuition for dynamic environments. Whether used in robotics, IoT, or smart ambient applications, Nebulei anticipates and optimizes system behavior through sensor fusion, predictive analytics, and adaptive control. Our goal is to build a robust and extensible framework that continuously adapts and improves. We believe open collaboration makes this vision possible.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Nebulei:

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a question, or need clarification, please:
- **Search** the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nebulei/nebulei/issues) to see if someone else has reported the same problem.
- **Create a new issue** providing detailed information:
  - Steps to reproduce the problem.
  - Expected versus actual behavior.
  - Environment details (e.g., operating system, compiler version, etc.).
  - Any relevant logs or screenshots.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We appreciate ideas for new features, improvements, or documentation updates:
- **Open an issue** marked as an enhancement to discuss your suggestions.
- **Provide examples** or use cases that highlight the benefit of the change.

### Submitting Code Changes (Pull Requests)

We welcome pull requests (PRs) that address issues, add features, or improve documentation. When submitting a PR:
1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch for your changes.
2. **Follow the code style guidelines** (see below).
3. **Write tests** to cover your changes and ensure existing functionality is not broken.
4. **Document your changes** appropriately.
5. **Submit a pull request** from your branch to our `main` branch.
6. **Engage with maintainers:** Respond to feedback and adjust your PR as needed.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Rust/Python Bindings:** If you contribute to these components, please follow the corresponding language's best practices.
- **Formatting:** Use a code formatter (e.g. `rustfmt`) to maintain consistency.
- **Modularity:** Keep components loosely coupled. Use abstract interfaces and clear module boundaries to ensure extensibility.

### Commit Messages

When writing commit messages:
- **Be descriptive:** Clearly state the purpose of the commit.
- **Reference Issues:** Include issue numbers when applicable (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- **Structure:**
  - **Title:** A short, imperative summary.
  - **Body:** A more detailed explanation of the changes (if necessary).

### Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Every new feature or bugfix should include unit tests.
- **Continuous Integration:** Make sure your changes pass all automated tests.
- **Test Coverage:** Try to maintain or improve code coverage to ensure the stability of the project.

### Documentation

- **API Documentation:** Keep the in-code documentation up-to-date (preferably using a tool like Doxygen).
- **User Guides:** Update the README and Wiki if your changes affect user-facing behavior.
- **Examples:** Provide examples under the `examples/` directory demonstrating how to use new features.
